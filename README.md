# php-forgot-pw

To implement a forgot password feature with email in PHP, you can follow these steps:

    Create a form with an input field for the user's email address and a submit button.

    On form submission, check if the email exists in your database. If the email exists, generate a unique token and save it to the database along with the user's email and a timestamp.

    Create an email template with a link to a password reset page that includes the generated token as a query parameter.

    Use the PHP mail() function to send the email to the user's email address with the link to the password reset page.

    When the user clicks on the link, retrieve the token from the query parameter and check if it exists in your database and is not expired. If the token is valid, allow the user to reset their password and update the password in your database.

Here is an example code snippet for generating a unique token:

scss

$token = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));

And here is an example code snippet for sending an email with PHP's mail() function:

swift

$to = 'user@example.com';
$subject = 'Password Reset Request';
$message = 'Click the link to reset your password: https://example.com/reset-password?token=' . $token;
$headers = 'From: webmaster@example.com' . "\r\n" .
    'Reply-To: webmaster@example.com' . "\r\n" .
    'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion();

mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);

Note that you should also add appropriate security measures, such as rate limiting and expiration times for the tokens, to prevent abuse of the forgot password feature.
